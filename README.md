# NJCovidSentiments.com
Minimal and modern multi-page responsive website.

This website template can be adjusted to meet a variety of project needs. It utilizes a Boostrap 4 foundation, JavaScript animations and functionaility, and code syntax highlighting. You'll also find a variety of R visualizations based on scripts from my COVID19_Tweet_Sentiments_NJ repo.
